**A no-nonsense guide to building web applications with Angular**

## About the book

As Angular continues to reign as one of the top JavaScript frameworks, more developers are seeking out the best way to get started with this extraordinarily flexible and secure framework. Learning Angular, now in its fourth edition, will show you how you can use it to achieve cross-platform high performance with the latest web techniques, extensive integration with modern web standards, and integrated development environments (IDEs).
s
The book is especially useful for those new to Angular and will help you to get to grips with the bare bones of the framework to start developing Angular apps. You'll learn how to develop apps by harnessing the power of the Angular command-line interface (CLI), write unit tests, style your apps by following the Material Design guidelines, and finally, deploy them to a hosting provider.

Updated for Angular 15, this new edition covers lots of new features and tutorials that address the current frontend web development challenges. You’ll find a new dedicated chapter on observables and RxJS, more on error handling and debugging in Angular, and new real-life examples.

By the end of this book, you’ll not only be able to create Angular applications with TypeScript from scratch, but also enhance your coding skills with best practices.

## What you will learn

- Use the Angular CLI to scaffold, build, and deploy a new Angular application
- Build components, the basic building blocks of an Angular application
- Discover new Angular Material components such as Google Maps, YouTube, and multi-select dropdowns
- Understand the different types of templates supported by Angular
- Create HTTP data services to access APIs and provide data to components
- Learn how to build Angular apps without modules in Angular 15.x with standalone APIs
- Improve your debugging and error handling skills during runtime and development

### Following is what you need for this book: ###

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book.

- You will need a version of Angular 15 installed on your computer, preferably the latest one. All code examples have been tested using Angular 15.0.0 on Windows, but they should work with any future release of Angular 15 as well.
- If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code via the GitHub repository. Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.

### Upgrade to Angular 16 ###

## Get to Know the Authors

Aristeidis Bampakos has over 20 years of experience in the software development industry. He is a Greek national who currently works in Athens as a Web Development Team Leader at Plex-Earth, specializing in the development of web applications using Angular.
He studied Computer Technology at the University of Portsmouth and in 2002 he was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Engineering with Second Class Honours (Upper Division). In 2004, he completed his MSc in Telecommunications Technology at Aston University. His career started as a C# .NET developer, but he saw the potential of web development and moved toward it in early 2011. He began working with AngularJS, and Angular later on, and in 2020 he was officially recognized as a Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Angular.
Aristeidis is passionate about helping the developer community learn and grow. In his book 'Learning Angular,' Aristeidis brings his knowledge of Angular gathered over the years together so that his readers can benefit from it effectively. Alongside this, he authored ‘Angular Projects’, which delves deeper into Angular web development applications.
As well as this, his love for teaching has led him to become an Angular Senior Tech Instructor at Code.Hub where he nurtures aspiring Angular developers and professionals.
In his spare time, he enjoys being an occasional speaker in meetups, conferences, and podcasts where he talks about Angular. He is currently leading the effort of making Angular accessible to the Greek development community by maintaining the open-source Greek translation of the official Angular documentation.
